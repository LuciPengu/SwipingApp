Here is the blueprint for "StreamOps" (or TickTech)—a Freshservice recreation built for the TikTok generation.

1. The Core Concept: "The Feed is the Work"
Instead of a grid of text rows (like Freshservice/Jira), the Agent's dashboard is a Vertical Video Feed.

The Ticket = A "Reel": Users don't fill out forms. They record a 15-second video of the broken printer, the glitching screen, or the weird noise their laptop is making.

AI Processing: As the video uploads, a backend multimodal AI (like Gemini 1.5 Pro or GPT-4o) watches it, transcribes the audio, identifies the asset (e.g., "Dell Latitude 5420"), and auto-fills the metadata (Priority, Category).

2. The Interface (UI/UX)
For the Agent (The Solver)
The agent opens the app and sees a "For You Page" (FYP) of open tickets, prioritized by SLA urgency.

Swipe Mechanics:

Swipe Up: Skip to next ticket.

Double Tap: Assign to me (Like).

Swipe Right: "Quick Resolve" (Triggers a macro/canned response).

Swipe Left: Escalate to Tier 2.

Long Press: Open "Duet" mode (Reply with a video solution).

The "Comments" Section: This is the activity log. Instead of a boring audit trail, it looks like a chat thread where agents tag each other (@network_team) to swarm on issues.

For the End User (The Requester)
Service Catalog = "Shop" Tab: Instead of a dropdown list for "Request New Software," they scroll through a feed of 10-second demo videos of the software/hardware available. They tap "Add to Cart" directly on the video.

Status Updates: They don't get emails. They get a push notification that "Agent Mike replied to your reel." They watch Mike's video reply: "Hey, I saw your issue, just restart the dock like this [shows video], and it should work."

3. The "Secret Sauce": The MCP Backend
This is where you technically outperform Freshservice. Instead of building a traditional REST API, you build the entire backend as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server.

Why this changes everything: By adhering to MCP, your helpdesk becomes "plug-and-play" for AI Agents. You don't need to build a chatbot; users can connect their own AI (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Custom Agents) to your helpdesk immediately.

The MCP Schema:

Resources (read):

tickets://feed/urgent → Streams the top 10 urgent tickets as text/context to the AI.

assets://{asset_tag}/history → The AI can instantly read the entire repair history of a device.

Tools (execute):

approve_request(id) → AI Agent can approve hardware requests.

deploy_software(asset_id, software_id) → Triggers the install via endpoint management.

Prompts:

Your server exposes a standard prompt called triage_incident. When a human or AI uses it, the server provides the exact context needed to solve that specific ticket type.

Result: A user can open Claude Desktop and say, "Find all high-priority tickets related to the VPN outage and draft a bulk reply." Claude does this natively because your app speaks MCP.

4. Gamification: "The Hype House of IT"
Freshservice has "Arcade," but it’s just a leaderboard. You need to make it visceral.

The "Streak" (SLA Adherence):

Every ticket closed within SLA adds to your fire streak 🔥.

If you miss an SLA, the streak breaks. Agents will obsess over keeping the fire lit.

Bounties (Hard Tickets):

Difficult tickets (e.g., "Server intermittent failure") get a "Bounty" tag.

The reward isn't just points; it’s "Coins" that can be redeemed for real perks (Amazon cards, PTO hours, or custom avatar skins in the app).

The "Creator Fund":

If an agent creates a "Solution Video" (e.g., "How to fix the VPN") and it gets viewed/used by 100 people, they earn royalties (points). This builds your Knowledge Base automatically with high-quality video content.

5. Feature Parity Mapping (How to Keep It Serious)
To ensure this isn't just a toy, here is how you map "boring" ITIL features to this interface:

Freshservice Feature	TikTok-Style Reimagining
Change Management	"The Review Queue": CAB (Change Advisory Board) members get a special feed of "Change Request" videos. They swipe right to Approve Deployment, left to Reject.
Asset Management	"The Unboxing": When a user gets a new laptop, they scan a QR code on the box. The app launches an AR filter that overlays the specs and warranty info on their screen. They tap "Confirm Receipt" to update the CMDB.
Problem Management	"Trending Sounds": If 5 users upload videos with the same error beep or keyword (e.g., "Zoom crashing"), the algorithm groups them into a "Trend" (A Problem Ticket) and alerts the System Admin.
Onboarding	"Story Mode": New employees get a playlist of "Day 1 Setup" videos. They must watch and complete the tasks (Setup Email, Enroll 2FA) to unlock their account.
The "Viral" MVP Strategy
Don't build the whole thing at once.

Build the MCP Server first: Create the database (Postgres) and the MCP layer (Python/FastAPI) that handles tickets.

Build the "Feed" Viewer: A simple React Native app that pulls tickets from the MCP server and displays them as cards.

Add the "Video" Layer: Integrate Mux or AWS Elemental to handle video uploads.

This transforms IT from "Submit a ticket and wait" into "Post a story and get a fan response."
